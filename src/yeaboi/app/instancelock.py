"""Single-instance guard for the desktop backend.

Exactly one ``yeaboi app`` may serve a given ``~/.yeaboi`` tree: two backends
would race the SQLite stores and double-run engines that assume one-at-a-time
use. The lock is an ``O_CREAT|O_EXCL`` file — no ``fcntl``, because this must
work on Windows — and staleness is decided by a *liveness probe*, not by pid
guessing: a lock is only honoured if the process it names still answers
``GET /api/health`` at the URL in the persisted handshake.

The happy conflict path is idempotent respawn: Electron restarted and spawned
a second ``yeaboi app`` while the first still runs. ``acquire()`` then returns
the *existing* handshake so the caller can print it and exit 0 — the shell
reconnects to the live backend and nothing is torn down.
