"""Where a roadmap lives, and whether this machine can read it.

The three sources, the prompt each one asks for, whether its credentials are
configured, and how a pasted URL becomes a :class:`RoadmapSource` — the parsing
already lived in ``ingest.py``, but the offer and the local-file checks were
spelled inline in the terminal page. Both surfaces read them from here.

Deliberately ``setup.py`` and not ``engine.py``: the engine glob in the parity
test registers every public name in ``engine.py`` as a capability of its own.
