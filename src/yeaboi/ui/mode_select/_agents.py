"""Routing and pages for the Agents family (agentwatch) in the TUI.

One dispatch entry (:func:`route_agent_mode`) instead of four more branches in
``select_mode``'s routing chain. Each mode wraps itself in ``mode_log`` (its own
log file under ~/.yeaboi/logs/agentwatch/) and its one-time beta notice.

All three pages share one threaded-engine loop: the page opens instantly on
the last saved report (age-stamped) and re-runs the pipeline on a daemon
thread only when that report is stale (``config.get_agentwatch_fresh_minutes``)
— a phase checklist / refresh banner shows while it runs, then the capped
fresh result swaps in (r re-runs behind the visible report, esc backs out).

Imports from :mod:`yeaboi.ui.mode_select` happen lazily inside function bodies —
the package imports this module's callers, so a top-level import is a cycle.

    A scoped page (``project_path`` set) skips the instant open: saved reports
    are machine-wide, so the last one would be the wrong report under a
    project's name. The repository shows in the subtitle instead.

    The page opens on the *last saved* report (stamped with its age) whenever
    one exists, while a daemon thread runs a fresh engine pass behind a
    "Refreshing…" banner — the loading screen only ever appears on a first run.
    While loading, the engine's structured progress events (analysis_component
    dicts) render as a phase checklist with a files meter; the queue is drained
    every frame (latest event per phase wins) so the display never lags the
    scan. The engines never raise (parse → fallback → format);
    ``make_failure_artifact`` is belt-and-braces for a bug — and a failed
    background refresh keeps the stale report on screen rather than replacing
    it with a failure artifact.

    On the result screen ←/→ move between Export / Copy / Re-run / Back and
    enter activates; `r` still re-runs (keeping the current report visible) and
    esc/q still backs out (a mid-run back-out lets the daemon finish + export).
    `w` cycles the window (7 / 30 / 90 days) on the windowed modes and re-runs;
    on Security `i` toggles the informational findings and `d` dismisses the
    focused finding after asking for a reason. Export writes the Markdown
    artifact, Copy puts the same Markdown on the clipboard — both report back
    through the page's notice line rather than a popup, because neither can
    fail in a way the user must acknowledge.
